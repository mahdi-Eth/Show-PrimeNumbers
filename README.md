### Enter a number and see all the prime numbers up to that number!

       A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
       A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.
       For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself.

       => 1,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,......
